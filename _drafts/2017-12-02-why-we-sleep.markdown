I'm making a second attempt at actually writing something in my blog. The idea is to write book summaries / reviews for myself which I may occansionally send out to friends. I should probably have a second blog for technical stuff that I work on and want to talk about. That's just overhead
keep this one blog and have the two categories. Technical articles and book reviews.

This should be a paragraph.

Bye.
