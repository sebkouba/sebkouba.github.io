### tl;dr
The world has become a much nicer place the you might think, especially over the last 50 years. Unfortunately we often barely notice.

### Read If
- You want to have a more objective view of the world
- Understand where the word is and where it is headed

### Key Messages
- Everything is better than expected
- Our genetic negativity filter may have been useful for survival but now it makes it harder to see progress.
- Level 0 to Level 4 of economic development are more useful categories than "us vs them"
- We think there is a gap between us and them - it's a continuous distribution withough gap
- Straight line trends break often
- Fear instinct: Our attention filters have fear shaped holes in them
-   The media use them
-   They make us miserable
- Single numbers lie 
-   What can this number be compared to?
-   What was it one year ago?
-   Can we turn it into a rate / percentage?
- Cultures change, there is no "African Destiny" to live in mud
- Any single perspective on an issue probably simplifies it too much
- Looking for somebody to blame is pointless and simplistic
- Urgency is often fake and leads to bad decisions

### Do I Agree
Yes. I have no reasons to doubt the numbers. It makes sense that our "engineering errors" as faulty humans cause the problems rather than evil intentions all around. I like the rules of thumb. It feels good that the world is better than I thought.

### Consequences
Invest into an Indian Stock Index. Be aware the "our" goldean era is likely coming to an end in the next few hundred years as Asia takes over.
