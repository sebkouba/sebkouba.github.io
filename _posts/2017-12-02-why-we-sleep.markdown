### tl;dr
- Around 50% of ADHD diagnosis in children might actually be down to sleep deprivation!
- Few things that seem harmless will impact your health as much as even slight lack of sleep
- You are three times more likely to crash in your car when you operate it on less than 5 hours of sleep!
- If you want Alzheimers asap make sure to be chronically sleep deprived
- Not many people are aware how big a deal sleep loss is because:
- You won't know how sleep deprived you really are when you are sleep deprived (unlike being drunk!)

### Read This Book If
If you're interested in maximising your mental and physical performance, sleep and thus this book can be of great help. Only people who enjoy great sleep quality and quantity will benefit from this book slightly less than everybody else. Since many people do have problmes with their sleep at some point during their lifetime, most people would find helpful information within.

### Key Messages
- Sleep is cruciual for physical and mental performance and development
- A lot of learning happens when you sleep (don't bother studying if you plan on not sleeping)
- Insufficient sleep quickly leads to disastrous effects on health and performance
- Mild sleep deprivation (6-7h of sleep per night for 5 days) reduces your brains performance in a similar way as being legally drunk does
- Drunk drivers may react late BUT microsleeps lead to no reaction => often more sever accidents than alcohol
- Make getting 8 hours of sleep a high priority goal
- The effects of not doing so will be dire possibly fatal
- The number of people who don't suffer ill effects from sleeping less than 8 hours is 0.00% if you round it
- People who brag about how little they sleep are idiots who put other people at risk if nothing else

### Do I Agree
Absolutely. I think the evidence is convincing and adhering to the advice in the book has improved my performance and quality of life. 

### Consequences of Reading the Book
Some of the statistics are scary. I'm even more willing to sacrifice other activities and also be more disciplined with going to bed.

### My Tips
- Set an alarm an hour before you want to be asleep
  - Switch off all electronics and get ready for bed
- Keep a notepad by your bed if you want to note things down that may keep you awake like todos for the next day (I like using Amazon Alexa for doing this verbally)
- Keep the same sleep schedule 7 days a week - single most important thing for me

### My Story and Thoughts
I still remember the one time I had a micro sleep while driving a van full of friends and family. I didn't see it coming. I wasn't fighting any drowsiness. The next thing I noticed was me jerking the wheel. I was really embarrassed and scared. How could my body betray me like this? Fortunately a narrow miss like this can be the key to being more vigilant if you survive it. Many people don't.

Aside from instances that can straight up kill you, to me sleep quality and quantity have turned out to be a much bigger factor in my overall well being that I would ever have guessed. I have gone through periods where I went to bed at 9.30 pm every night and got up at 5.30. Doing this 7 days a week made so many things easier. I didn't dread Mondays nearly as much. My productivity was higher than ever and I felt like I had my life under control. I had my lifx leds set up to dim the light in the evening at start coming on 15min before my alarm went off. Often that was enough to wake me. 

Then life got in the way and it has often been a struggle to stick to a schedule this strict. Social life does interfere with my sleeping habits but I have learned to prioritise sleep much more than I used to and I'm a happier person for it.

Go sleep.
