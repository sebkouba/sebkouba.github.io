### tl;dr
- Drugs are bad, policies used to combat them are worse
- Focusing on supply has very little impact
- Strict drug laws directly result in violence and profits for cartels

### Read If
- You are interested in understanding a large part of the underground economy 
- Want to have a more informed opinion on drug laws

### Key Messages
- Focusing on the supply of drugs is often pointless
- The raw materials are cheap and grown by desparately poor farmers (for Cocain and Marijuana)
- More morder controls in the US have intensified the competition for crossings and cause insane violence
- Profit markets for smuggling Cocain are so high that it remains profitable even when airplanes become single-use items and crash on landing
- Overprescription of opiods in the US has revived the heroin market. The cartels are ever grateful to big pharma
- Legal Marijuana is cutting into cartel profits so go for it! 
- Legal drugs mean better products, oversight, regulation, tax income, reduced crime rates
- Prisons make recruitment for Cartels much easier than it should be
- Spending money on fighting cocaine at different points in the chain makes a huge difference:
   - $1M at source -> 10kg less in USA
   - $1m against smuggling -> 20kg less
   - $1m on education in schools -> 25kg less
   - $1m on addict treatment -> 100kg less
- In Switzerland the treatment approach lead to a collapse in the illegal Heroin market
- Politicians love spending money on fighting crime because guns look cool and treating addicts doesn't
- War on Drugs has globally cost over a trilliion USD and the result is a roughly 50% increase in consumption - success

### Do I Agree
- Yes. Legalize and treat addicts instead of funding cartels indirectly. Cars are more lethal than weed and we managed there ffs.

### Consequences
- Don't buy illegal drugs, you're funding savages!
- Support legalization efforts
