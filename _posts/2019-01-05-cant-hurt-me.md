### tl;dr
We should embrace adversity to toughen up our minds.

### Read If
- You want to hear the story of one tough / crazy SEAL

### Key Messages
- Try to callus your mind to withstand more adversity
- Search for pleasure does the opposite
- The body can handle a lot more than we think

### Do I Agree
The basic idea is interesting. Some of the stories could have easily ended with Goggins dying for no good reason. 
Running a 24h race with zero prep is clever or even tough, it's stupid. If you're pissing blood and shitting yourself, keeping going isn't
a sign of bravery. That's my beef with the book. 

I enjoy pushing myself and I'm pretty good at it but Goggins gets pleasure from self destruction and I don't think it should be advertised.
Having said that, the stories are entertaining and the book had a motivating effect on me. The domestic violence is tough to read about
but aside from that I inhaled the book rather quickly.
