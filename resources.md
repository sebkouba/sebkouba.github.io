## Videos
### Fun
[Sandstorm New Years Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db5f-A-vSyw){:target="_blank"}

### Documentaries
Amazing documentary about how the (in this case American) elite is rigging the economy to their advantage. It's hard to dismiss as conspiracy or nonsense since the source is Robert Reich, form Secretary of Labor!
[Saving Capitalism - Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80127558){:target="_blank"}
