### Me
I'm an athlete turned wannabe Nerd trying to improve my IT skills and find meaningful work.

#### Jekyll
This site is built using Jekyll, github pages hosting and a simple DNS entry. The styling is vanilla. The site is meant to be about the content.

#### SSL
This page is not encrypted because I'm not collecting any data. It's less workd and I don't care about page rank.

#### Simulation Analysis
I'm fascinated with the idea that we might be living in a simulation. [Kurzgesagt Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlTKTTt47WE)

This site doesn't have a real focus so I'm going with that.
